# Hybrid S3 + RDBMS Architecture Analysis

## Cost/Benefit Analysis for MLOps Training Pipeline

### **Storage Cost Comparison**

#### **S3-Only Approach**
```yaml
Monthly Data Volume: ~500GB (1 year Bitcoin data)
S3 Standard Storage: $0.023/GB/month
Monthly S3 Cost: 500GB × $0.023 = $11.50/month
Annual Storage Cost: $138/year

# Parquet file structure
s3://bitcoin-data-lake/gold/
├── features_2s/BTCUSDT/year=2024/month=*/day=*/*.parquet (300GB)
├── labels_10s/BTCUSDT/year=2024/month=*/day=*/*.parquet (50GB)
└── training_datasets/experiment_*//*.parquet (150GB)
```

#### **Hybrid S3 + RDBMS Approach**
```yaml
S3 Storage (Bronze/Silver + Model Artifacts): ~300GB
S3 Monthly Cost: 300GB × $0.023 = $6.90/month

RDBMS Storage (Feature Store): ~200GB structured data
Aurora PostgreSQL: ~$0.10/GB/month
RDBMS Monthly Cost: 200GB × $0.10 = $20/month

Total Monthly Cost: $6.90 + $20 = $26.90/month
Annual Storage Cost: $323/year

Cost Increase: $323 - $138 = +$185/year (+134% increase)
```

### **Compute Cost Comparison**

#### **S3-Only Training Costs**
```python
# Training data loading from S3 parquet files
training_job_duration = 45 minutes  # Spark cluster scan + transform
ec2_instance_cost = $0.50/hour × 4 instances = $2.00/hour
training_compute_cost = 0.75 hours × $2.00 = $1.50 per training run

# Monthly training (weekly retraining)
monthly_training_cost = 4 runs × $1.50 = $6.00/month
```

#### **RDBMS Training Costs**
```sql
-- Fast SQL training data query
SELECT * FROM ml_training_data 
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
  AND data_quality_score > 0.95;
-- Query time: 30 seconds vs 20 minutes for S3 scan

training_job_duration = 5 minutes  # Fast SQL query + training
aurora_compute_cost = $0.15/hour × 2 ACU = $0.30/hour
training_compute_cost = 0.08 hours × $0.30 = $0.025 per training run

# Monthly training (can retrain daily due to speed)
monthly_training_cost = 30 runs × $0.025 = $0.75/month
```

**Training Cost Savings: $6.00 - $0.75 = -$5.25/month (-87% reduction)**

### **Performance Benefits**

#### **Training Data Access Speed**
```python
# S3 Parquet Scan (Current)
data_loading_time = 15-20 minutes
feature_engineering_time = 5-10 minutes  
total_preprocessing_time = 20-30 minutes

# RDBMS Query (Hybrid)
data_loading_time = 10-30 seconds
feature_engineering_time = 0 seconds (pre-computed)
total_preprocessing_time = 10-30 seconds

Speed Improvement: 40x - 180x faster data access
```

#### **Experiment Iteration Velocity**
```yaml
S3-Only Approach:
  - Feature engineering: Manual, in Python/Spark
  - Experiment tracking: Manual logging
  - Model comparison: File-based artifacts
  - Training iteration cycle: 45+ minutes

RDBMS Approach:
  - Feature engineering: SQL views (instant)
  - Experiment tracking: Built-in database tables
  - Model comparison: Structured queries
  - Training iteration cycle: 5-10 minutes

Development Velocity: 5-9x faster iteration cycles
```

### **MLOps Capability Gains**

#### **Feature Store Benefits**
```sql
-- Real-time feature serving (impossible with S3)
SELECT price, return_1s, volume_1s, spread_bp 
FROM feature_store 
WHERE timestamp = (SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM feature_store)
  AND symbol = 'BTCUSDT';
-- Query time: <10ms

-- Complex feature engineering via SQL
CREATE VIEW ml_features_v2 AS
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    price,
    LAG(price, 5) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) as price_lag_5s,
    AVG(volume_1s) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp ROWS 30 PRECEDING) as volume_ma_30s,
    CASE 
        WHEN spread_bp > 5 THEN 'high_spread'
        ELSE 'normal_spread' 
    END as spread_regime
FROM feature_store;
```

#### **Experiment Tracking & Model Registry**
```sql
-- Track all experiments with structured metadata
INSERT INTO ml_experiments (
    experiment_name, model_type, hyperparameters,
    validation_accuracy, test_accuracy, s3_model_path
) VALUES (
    'lstm_v1.2', 'LSTM', '{"layers": 3, "dropout": 0.2}',
    0.67, 0.64, 's3://models/lstm_v1.2.pkl'
);

-- Compare model performance across experiments
SELECT model_type, AVG(test_accuracy), COUNT(*) as experiments
FROM ml_experiments 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY model_type
ORDER BY AVG(test_accuracy) DESC;
```

#### **Data Quality & Monitoring**
```sql
-- Automated data quality metrics
SELECT 
    DATE(timestamp) as date,
    AVG(data_quality_score) as avg_quality,
    AVG(feature_completeness) as avg_completeness,
    COUNT(*) as records_count
FROM feature_store 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Feature drift detection
SELECT 
    feature_name,
    AVG(feature_value) as current_avg,
    LAG(AVG(feature_value), 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as prev_week_avg,
    ABS(AVG(feature_value) - LAG(AVG(feature_value), 7) OVER (ORDER BY date)) / 
    LAG(AVG(feature_value), 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) as drift_percentage
FROM feature_statistics
GROUP BY date, feature_name
HAVING drift_percentage > 0.1;  -- 10% drift threshold
```

### **Operational Benefits**

#### **Backup & Recovery**
```yaml
S3 Approach:
  - Backup: Native S3 versioning
  - Recovery: Full bucket restore
  - RTO: Hours (re-process all parquet files)
  - RPO: 24 hours (daily snapshots)

RDBMS Approach:
  - Backup: Aurora continuous backup + S3 export
  - Recovery: Point-in-time restore
  - RTO: 15 minutes (database restore)
  - RPO: 1 second (continuous backup)
```

#### **Data Consistency & ACID**
```sql
-- ACID transactions for consistent updates
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO feature_store (...) VALUES (...);
INSERT INTO ml_experiments (...) VALUES (...);
UPDATE model_registry SET deployed = TRUE WHERE model_id = 123;
COMMIT;  -- All succeed or all fail

-- Referential integrity
ALTER TABLE ml_experiments 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_model_registry 
FOREIGN KEY (model_id) REFERENCES model_registry(model_id);
```

### **Scale Considerations**

#### **Storage Growth Projections**
```yaml
Year 1: 200GB RDBMS feature store
Year 2: 400GB (linear growth with more symbols/features)
Year 3: 600GB (additional crypto pairs, higher frequency)

RDBMS Cost Growth:
Year 1: $20/month
Year 2: $40/month  
Year 3: $60/month

At 600GB, consider partitioning strategies:
- Time-based partitioning (monthly tables)
- Symbol-based partitioning  
- Archive old data to S3 (cold storage)
```

#### **Query Performance at Scale**
```sql
-- Partitioning for performance
CREATE TABLE feature_store_2024_01 PARTITION OF feature_store
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Indexes for fast training queries
CREATE INDEX idx_feature_store_symbol_time ON feature_store (symbol, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_experiments_accuracy ON ml_experiments (test_accuracy DESC);

-- Expected query performance at 600GB:
SELECT * FROM ml_training_data 
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';
-- Query time: 2-5 seconds (vs 45+ minutes S3 scan)
```

## **Final Recommendation**

### **Use Hybrid S3 + RDBMS Approach** ✅

**Total Cost Impact:**
- **Storage**: +$185/year (affordable for MLOps benefits)
- **Compute**: -$63/year (faster training cycles)
- **Net Cost**: +$122/year (+$10/month)

**Value Delivered:**
- **40-180x faster** training data access
- **5-9x faster** experiment iteration cycles  
- **Built-in MLOps** capabilities (feature store, experiment tracking)
- **Real-time serving** potential for features
- **Better data quality** monitoring and drift detection
- **Production-ready** model registry and deployment tracking

**ROI Analysis:**
- Cost: +$10/month
- Developer productivity: 5x faster iterations = 20+ hours saved/month
- Time value: 20 hours × $50/hour = $1000/month saved
- **ROI: 100x return on investment**

The slight storage cost increase is easily justified by the massive productivity gains and MLOps capabilities that enable faster model development and deployment cycles.
