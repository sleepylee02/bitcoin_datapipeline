## üéØ Quick Navigation

### For New Developers
1. Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the system
2. Review [DATA_PIPELINE.md](architecture/DATA_PIPELINE.md) for data flow details
3. Follow [TESTING_GUIDE.md](operations/TESTING_GUIDE.md) to set up your development environment

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Review [AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](deployment/AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for infrastructure
2. Check [SERVICES_DEPLOYMENT.md](deployment/SERVICES_DEPLOYMENT.md) for service deployment
3. Set up monitoring with [MONITORING.md](operations/MONITORING.md)

### For Data Engineers
1. Understand data flow in [DATA_PIPELINE.md](architecture/DATA_PIPELINE.md)
2. Review schema documentation in [schemas/](schemas/)
3. Check [HYBRID_S3_RDBMS_ANALYSIS.md](schemas/HYBRID_S3_RDBMS_ANALYSIS.md) for storage decisions

### For ML Engineers
1. Start with [RDS_SCHEMA.md](schemas/RDS_SCHEMA.md) for training data structure
2. Review [S3_SCHEMA.md](schemas/S3_SCHEMA.md) for data lake organization
3. Check [SERVICES_ROADMAP.md](development/SERVICES_ROADMAP.md) for ML service priorities

## üìã Documentation Standards

- **Keep docs up-to-date**: Update documentation when making changes to the system
- **Use clear headings**: Follow markdown best practices for navigation
- **Include examples**: Provide code examples and configuration snippets
- **Link references**: Use relative links between documentation files
- **Add diagrams**: Include architecture diagrams and data flow charts where helpful

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is current and accurate
2. **Clarity**: Write for the target audience (developers, operators, etc.)
3. **Completeness**: Cover all necessary details without overwhelming
4. **Consistency**: Follow the existing documentation style and structure
