# Health Check and Heartbeat Service

# TODO: Implement HTTP health check endpoint
# - Simple HTTP server (use aiohttp or FastAPI)
# - GET /health endpoint
# - GET /ready endpoint (readiness probe)
# - GET /live endpoint (liveness probe)
# - Return JSON with service status

# TODO: Health status checks
# - WebSocket connection status (connected/disconnected)
# - Last message received timestamp (detect stale connection)
# - Kinesis producer status (healthy/degraded)
# - Memory usage
# - Message processing rate

# TODO: Implement heartbeat mechanism
# - Emit heartbeat message every 30s
# - Include metadata: timestamp, version, uptime
# - Send to separate Kinesis stream or CloudWatch
# - Track consecutive heartbeat failures

# TODO: Graceful degradation
# - Mark service as degraded (not failed) if WebSocket reconnecting
# - Mark as unhealthy if no data received for >2 minutes
# - Provide detailed status in response body
