# Kinesis Data Streams Producer

# TODO: Initialize Kinesis client
# - Use boto3 for AWS Kinesis client
# - Support LocalStack for local development
# - Configure region, stream name from config
# - Set up credentials (IAM role in production, local creds in dev)

# TODO: Implement put_record method
# - Accept serialized Avro bytes
# - Generate partition key (e.g., by symbol for even distribution)
# - Add sequence number tracking
# - Batch records if possible (put_records for better throughput)
# - Return success/failure status

# TODO: Implement buffering and batching
# - Buffer records in memory (configurable size, e.g., 500 records)
# - Flush on buffer full or time interval (e.g., 1 second)
# - Async batch writes to Kinesis
# - Handle partial batch failures

# TODO: Monitoring and metrics
# - Track put_record success/failure count
# - Measure latency for Kinesis writes
# - Track buffer size and flush frequency
# - Emit CloudWatch metrics

# TODO: Error handling
# - Retry with exponential backoff on throttling
# - Handle ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
# - Dead letter queue for failed records after max retries
# - Circuit breaker pattern if Kinesis is down
